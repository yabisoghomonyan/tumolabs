Simple Countdown Timer (Console-Based)

This is a basic console countdown timer written in **Python**. The program allows users to input a time in `hours:minutes:seconds` format and then counts down to zero, displaying the remaining time every second.

Features

- Accepts input in `h:m:s` format (e.g., `0:1:30`)
- Validates that input values are:
  - In correct format
  - Non-negative integers
- Displays the timer in `HH:MM:SS` format
- Pauses for one second using `time.sleep(1)` to simulate real-time countdown
- Displays `"Time is up"` message when the countdown ends

How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Copy the code into a file named `timer.py` (or any name you like).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the same folder.
4. Run the program:

```bash
python3 timer.py
