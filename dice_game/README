# Dice Game (Craps Simulation)

This is a simple Python program that simulates a game of **Craps**, a popular dice game.

##How It Works

1. The program rolls two dice.
2. If the sum is **7** or **11**, you win immediately.  
3. If the sum is **2**, **3**, or **12**, you lose immediately.  
4. Otherwise, that number becomes your **goal**.
5. The program keeps rolling until:
   - You roll your **goal number again** → You win 
   - You roll a **7** → You lose
